“PySolfC Solving a Freecell Deal Using the Freecell Solver Qualified Seed
Improved preset”

<blockquote>

Since my last screenshot of PySolFC solving a deal using Freecell Solver, the solver has improved. More recently, some work was done to improve the average solution length and this aims to be a demonstration of it.

The configuration used is: "-l qualified-seed -fif 5 --flares-choice fcpro".

Other programs used in the creation of this video were recordmydesktop ( http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php ), GVim ( http://www.vim.org/ ), ffmpeg

Some extra thanks go to Danny A. Jones and Gary Campbell from the fc-solve-discuss mailing list (who inspired and/or contributed to some of the changes) and to soryy708 and snowyrooftops who started to work on an alternative GUI to Freecell Solver, which may complement PySolFC.

Happy holidays everyone!
